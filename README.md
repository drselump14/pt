## Setup

    gem install pt

The first time you run it, `pt` will ask you some data about your Pivotal Tracker account and your current project.

## Usage

Run `pt` from the root folder of your project.

```
  pt                                                                      # show all available stories

  pt todo      <owner>                                                    # show all unscheduled stories

  pt (unscheduled,started,finished,delivered, accepted, rejected) <owner> # show all (unscheduled,started,finished,delivered, accepted, rejected) stories

  pt create    [title] <owner> <type> -m                                  # create a new story (and include description ala git commit)

  pt show      [id]                                                       # shows detailed info about a story

  pt tasks     [id]                                                       # manage tasks of story

  pt open      [id]                                                       # open a story in the browser

  pt assign    [id] <owner>                                               # assign owner

  pt comment   [id] [comment]                                             # add a comment

  pt label     [id] [label]                                               # add a label

  pt estimate  [id] [0-3]                                                 # estimate a story in points scale

  pt (start,finish,deliver,accept)     [id]                               # mark a story as started

  pt reject    [id] [reason]                                              # mark a story as rejected, explaining why

  pt done      [id]  <0-3> <comment>                                      # lazy mans finish story, opens, assigns to you, estimates, finish & delivers

  pt find      [query]                                                    # looks in your stories by title and presents it

  pt list      [owner]                                                    # list all stories for another pt user

  pt list      all                                                        # list all stories for all users

  pt updates                                                              # shows number recent activity from your current project

  pt recent                                                               # shows stories you've recently shown or commented on with pt

  All commands can be run entirely without arguments for a wizard based UI. Otherwise [required] <optional>.
  Anything that takes an id will also take the num (index) from the pt command.
```

## Problems?

[Open a new issue](https://github.com/raul/pt/issues/new). It can be helpful to include a trace of the requests and responses you're getting from Pivotal Tracker: you can get it by adding the `--debug` parameter while invoking `ptt` (remember to remove all sensible data though).
